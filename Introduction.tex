University life is a vibrant combination of academic pursuits, social interactions, and day-to-day logistical concerns. During their educational journey, students face several challenges.\\

In today's fast-paced world, university students often struggle to build useful social networks and find like-minded friends. Traditional networking methods (random meetings and associative activities) may not suffice in today's digital age. So there's a growing demand for creative solutions that cater specifically to the needs of students, enabling them to have the best experience of their lives.\\

The daily trip to and from campus can be time-consuming, expensive, tiring, and environmentally damaging. Students often struggle to find efficient transportation solutions, especially when they live off-campus or need to participate in extracurricular activities.\\

As a result, students lose the motivation to learn and go to university due to depression and other mental illnesses that will affect their grades and their future.\\

This is the general context of my end-of-study project at Appaxis Innovations. The solution is called "Uni-world", a student-centered mobile application designed to meet these challenges. The app aims to cover these needs in a way that is simple, creative, and fun for students.\\

To better explain the project, I present the elements of this application in this report, which will be divided into four chapters as follows:\\

\begin{itemize}


    \item The first chapter will present the general context of the project.\\ 
    \item The second chapter will present the detailed specifications and requirements analysis, the technical and methodological choice and the technical study of the project.\\
    \item The third chapter details the platform design, using class diagrams, use case diagrams, and sequence diagrams to highlight the main features of the application.\\
    \item Finally, the fourth chapter, which deals with the working environment, presents the application's various screens with a detailed description.\\
\end{itemize}
